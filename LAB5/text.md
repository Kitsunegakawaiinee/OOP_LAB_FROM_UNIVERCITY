เปิดเรื่อง
This story is based on my Yuri Fiction that I wish I could publish to the world wild on somedays.

Monika appeared on the battlefield of 4 Hero and Devil King's army.
I already knew that, so I prepared for today, prepared to bring her back with me. 

Now, I am standing on the ground in front of her flying in the sky.

What should I do?
